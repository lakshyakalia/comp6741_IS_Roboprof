Reading 1.21 Summary I “Data is the new oil” Organizations have invaluable knowledge “hidden” in documents:
• Products, inventions, solutions, techniques, experiences, insights, . . . NLP/Text Mining can unlock this knowledge What do you need? • Need business vision to drive adoption
• Technology is mature and foundations are open source E.g., IBM’s UIMA or University of Sheffield’s GATE Risks • Increasing legal and ethical concerns
E.g., Ethical AI, Responsible AI, Explainable AI  René Witte Introduction
