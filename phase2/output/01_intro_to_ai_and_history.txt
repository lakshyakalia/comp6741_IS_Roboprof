What is artificial intelligence? ◼ No standard definition of AI among those working in the field ◼ AI has even been defined as: “… the collection of problems and methodologies studied by artificial intelligence researchers." - Luger and StubbleField 9 Other Definitions Machines that think like humans ◼ The exciting new effort to make computers think… machines with minds, in the full and literal sense (Haugeland, 1985) ◼ The automation of activities that we associate with human thinking, activities such as decision-making, problem solving, learning… (Bellmann 1978) Machines that act like humans ◼ The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people (Kurzweil, 1990) ◼ The study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better. (Rich and Knight, 1991) Machines that think intelligently ◼ The study of mental faculties through the use of computational models (Charniak and McDermott, 1985) ◼ The study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, and act (Winston, 1992) Machines that act intelligently ◼ A field of study that seeks to explain and emulate intelligent behavior in terms in terms of computational processes (Schalkoff, 1990) ◼ The branch of computer science that is concerned with the automation of intelligent behavior (Luger & Stubblefield, 1993) 10 Approaches to AI: Engineering VS Cognitive Approach ◼ Engineering Approach: ❑ Tries to find optimal solutions ❑ No matter how (not necessarily what human do) ◼ Cognitive Approach: ❑ Tries to understand the process ❑ Tries to reproduce human behavior (even if wrong result) ◼ 4 points of view: Systems that can… Cognitive approach (Human-Based) Engineering / Rational approach (Ideal Rationality) Behavior act like humans act intelligently Reasoning think like humans think intelligently 11 Approaches to AI: Weak VS Strong AI ◼ Weak AI : ❑ A system whose capabilities are not intended to match or exceed the capabilities of human beings. ❑ A system can demonstrate intelligence, but does not necessarily have a mind, mental states or consciousness. ❑ Usually, a small application with a single purpose ◼ Strong AI: ❑ typically used in science fiction ❑ A system that matches or exceeds human intelligence. ❑ A system that could have: consciousness, self-awareness, the ability to feel sentiments, … ❑ Usually, a “general purpose” application capable of several tasks 12 Today ◼ The current “AI Hype” ◼ Important questions 1.

For these and nearly all realistic AI problems, the brute force methods in Deep Blue are hopelessly inadequate.” – David Stork 21 Is Watson Intelligent? ◼ In 2011, IBM’s Watson competed on Jeopardy! ◼ Watson beat Brad Rutter, the biggest all-time money winner on Jeopardy!, and Ken Jennings, the record holder for the longest championship streak ◼ Watson received the first prize of $1 million ◼ Watson is a question answering system...

What is artificial intelligence? 2. What is intelligence? 3. Is there a test for intelligence? ◼ What do we do in AI? ◼ History of AI ◼ An example: Eliza 59 Eliza ◼ Developed by Joseph Weizenbaum ◼ In the 1960’s ◼ Simulation of a dialogue with a psychologist ◼ Great success at the time ❑ Led at least one psychologist to seriously suggest that computers might help alleviate the shortage of trained psychotherapists (!) ◼ Weizenbaum later questioned his own work and became one of the field’s biggest critics 60 Eliza is... ◼ An example of a simple production system (see later for a discussion of this type of systems) ◼ Example dialogs with our new psychotherapist... 61 Session with Eliza ◼ I am the psychotherapist. Please, describe your problems. Each time you are finished talking, type RET twice. ◼ I am very unhappy these days ◼ Are you unhappy often? ◼ Always after the new classes start ◼ Tell me about your classes. ◼ I am registered for artificial intelligence ◼ Why do you say you are registered for artificial intelligence? ◼ I feel I should understand more about AI ◼ Earlier you said you felt unhappy? ◼ I am unhappy because of the examinations ◼ Are you sure that is the real reason? ◼ Not really ◼ Maybe the examinations have something to do with this. ◼ This could be one of the reasons ◼ Is it because of your plans that you say this could be one of the reasons? 63 How does Eliza work? ◼ See Weizenbaum’s paper at: http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/331/papers/eliza.html “Input sentences are analyzed on the basis of decomposition rules which are triggered by key words appearing in the input text. Responses are generated by reassembly rules associated with selected decomposition rules.” http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/331/papers/eliza.html 64 Algorithm 1. Identify Keywords: 1. Scan the input sentence to look for words in a dictionary of keywords. 2. Keywords are given a rank, and the highest ranking keyword is considered first 2. Get Decomposition Patterns 1. For each keyword, there is an associated list of decomposition patterns 2. The first decomposition pattern that matches the input sentence is selected. 3. If the decomposition rule does not match, then the next best ranking keyword is selected (and go back to step 2.1). 3. Apply Reassembly Pattern 1. For each decomposition rule, there is a set of associated reassembly patterns to generate a response. 2. If a subsequent sentence selects the same decomposition pattern, the next reassembly pattern is used (so the output is not repetitive) 4. If there is no keywords in the input sentence, then generate a canned response 65 Example ◼ If the input sentence is: ❑ I am very unhappy these days. ◼ Eliza's response will be: ❑ How long have you been very unhappy these days? ◼ Keyword: ❑ I am ◼ Decomposition pattern: ❑ I am <whatever> ◼ Reassembly Pattern: ❑ How long have you been <whatever>? 66 A More Complex Example ◼ Input sentence: "It seems that you hate me". ◼ Keywords: "you" and "me“ ◼ Decomposition pattern: ❑ <whatever1> you <whatever2> me ❑ It seems that you hate me ◼ Reassembly pattern ❑ What makes you think I hate you? notice the pronoun (me from the user --> you for Eliza) notice the pronoun (you from the user --> I for Eliza) 67 Another Session with Eliza ◼ I am the psychotherapist.
